                        Welcome to our What&apos;s Up Danger project page! We
                        are Team 35 from BYU-Idaho&apos;s 2024 I-Hack Hackathon,
                        an interdisciplinary team united by a shared passion for
                        innovation and exploration. As college students
                        preparing for our future endeavors, we recognized the
                        importance of assessing the safety of potential
                        locations we might call home. Thus, we developed this
                        platform to score counties based on their danger levels.
                        This project not only allows us to utilize our
                        interdisciplinary skills but also provides a unique
                        opportunity to experiment with unfamiliar concepts and
                        technologies. Through collaboration across various
                        fields of study, we aim to create a meaningful tool that
                        reflects our commitment to using our diverse expertise
                        in innovative ways. Join us on this exciting journey as
                        we push the boundaries of interdisciplinary
                        collaboration!
